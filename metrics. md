# 📏 AI Recommender System – Success Metrics

To evaluate the AI Movie Recommender, I defined the following success metrics:

## 1. Precision
- Of the movies recommended, how many were actually relevant to the user?  
- Example: If 10 movies were recommended and 7 were relevant → Precision = 70%.

## 2. Recall
- Of all the relevant movies available, how many were captured in recommendations?  
- Example: If there are 20 relevant movies and 7 were recommended → Recall = 35%.

## 3. Diversity
- Are recommendations varied across genres, actors, and styles?  
- Prevents the system from always suggesting only one type of movie.

## 4. Engagement
- Measured by user actions: clicks, views, or watch time on recommended movies.  
- Helps link AI performance to business outcomes.

### 📌 Why These Metrics?
These metrics ensure the system is not only accurate but also useful, fair, and aligned with user satisfaction and business goals.
